# AI-Powered Chatbot for Supplier and Product Information

## Overview  
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to query a supplier and product database using natural language.  
It retrieves relevant product and supplier details from a MySQL database and summarizes them using **Gemma-2-9b-it** via the **Groq API**.  
The chatbot is built using **LangGraph** for agent workflows and **FastAPI** for backend communication.
